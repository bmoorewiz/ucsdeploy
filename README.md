# ucsdeploy

This file will walk you through deploying a UCS installtion mostly used with vmware. 

You can either use a file to keep the variables, or the script will ask you for them. 

This will create UUID, MAC, WWPn, WWNN pools and a service profile with all attached updating profiles. It can also create vlans with names and assign all of them
to the NIC interfaces.
